            Looks like you've stumbled onto the Admin portion of this Mock Store... The tabs are 
            self-explanatory.

            Don't delete every product, or some bed bugs will get you or something.
        </p>
        <p> Ps. Please don't add any weird products. </p>
        <p> I said please... </p>
