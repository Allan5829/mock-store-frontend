## What is this?

This is an attempt to make a recreation/clone of an ecommerce website. Current functionality is limited but there are plans to further develope this app. There are two interchangeable views, a consumer and an admin view. A consumer should be able to view products and an admin should be able to add new products and delete them as well. Future planned features include a basic shopping cart, sort and filter capability, and other quality-of-life features.
